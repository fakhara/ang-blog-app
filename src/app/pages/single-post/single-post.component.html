                    <p>What is the lorem text?
                        Lorem ipsum, placeholder or dummy text used in typesetting and graphic design for previewing layouts. 
                        It features scrambled Latin text, which emphasizes the design over content of the layout. 
                        It is the standard placeholder text of the printing and publishing industries.
                        Why do we use it?
                        In the age of desktop publishing and, later, web design, Lorem Ipsum became a standard placeholder. 
                        Its use expanded beyond the printing press, thanks to its nonsensical but natural-looking distribution of letters and words.

                        Where does it come from?
                        If you need to enter 'lorem ipsum' text, just type lorem in a text control and we'll do the rest!
                        We'll add a bunch of text you can use. Also notice that we have a little character counter in the corner, should you need it.
